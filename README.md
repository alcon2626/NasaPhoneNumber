# NasaPhoneNumber
  I have to generate a phone number, In order to provide security, the last 6 digits of the phone number must add to 33.
	If the fourth number is odd the fifth number must be even. Likewise, if the fourth number
	is even the fifth number must be odd. Write a phone number generator that asks for the first four digits.
	The computer must generate a list of all possible phone numbers that meet the new security rule,
	and display them as follows*/
	//(xxx)xxx-xxxx
